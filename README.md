# fonts-collection  2023

A List of fonts that currently amuse me - February 2023

cannot find a way to keep Typeface favorites on Google Fonts. also, the u interface annoys me. 

Currently made a crude Codepen, akin to those made by pre-history humans on cave walls. https://codepen.io/AmaltheaLir/pen/QWBXRJX 
Interestingly, using screenshots and links are a fast at-a-glance combination in Notion. Notion is awesome. 

Probably smart people would make an app/site which adds these into a data form, combining to output an at a glance view of the typeface sample, name, with the needed code, etc.  Maybe this will happen in the future... Maybe unicorns still exist - who knows?
